          <p>Namaste Everyone!!! I am Palash Sharma, a guy with good sense
              of humour. I love to learn about various things around me especially 
            I always have an inclination to learn from lives of Great personalities. 
              I have a predilection for technology which has inspired me to persuade 
              my career in intriguing world of AI. At the same time, I desire to try out myself
            in field of Management. </p>

         <h3>Artificial Intelligence Enthusiast</h3>
         <p>I strongly believe fields like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
             are the next big thing of this millenium.If provided with apt guidance, Human Mankind
            will be facilitated with innovations and inventions by AI. I have built a strong 
             propensity for AI and its applications in various fields. I get fascinated by the results
            which we can extract from existing data.
            I have also written multiple articles along with their practical implementation on topics related to 
            Data Science and Machine Learning on Stepup Analytics platform. You can view the <a href="https://stepupanalytics.com/author/palash09/" target="_blank"><u><b>articles</b></u></a> from here. 
            The most interesting thing which fascinates me about this field is its black box nature i.e. 
             sometimes we cannot decipher how our AI came to such results.
         </p>

        <h3>Sports Lover</h3>
        <p>Apart from technology, there resides a sports fanatic inside me, who loves to watch various
            kinds of football leagues, cricket matches. Having experienced cricket very closely,
           I think sports provide a way to rejuvenate and also integrates a whole nation. Furthermore,
            in football my favorite part are the strategies which teams use to counter different opponents. 
        Due to my passion in football, I had undertaken a content writing internship at <a href="https://arsedevils.com/author/palashsharma//" target="_blank"><u><b>Arsedevils</b></u></a>.
        I think due to my interests in management field, I like football to a greater extent. </p>

        <h3>Orator, Book Reader and Student who loves to Teach</h3>
        <p>One of my hobby is public speaking. I feel the ability to express yourself
            is one of the major prowess which we possess and thus we should utilise to its best. Along
           with this, I am an avid book reader. Some of my favorite books are The Alchemist, The Secret,The Monk who sold his ferrari.
            With all of this, I have always had a propensity to teach and through <a href="https://unacademy.com/@Palash/" target="_blank"><u><b>Unacademy</b></u></a>, I could do this and reach out to the masses. I have had more than 12000+ views
            on my video lessons.
